# OCTANE-API
Open Car (Mobility) Testing Automation Networked Environment API.

The OCTANE API provides facility enumeration, control, orchestration, data collection, and simulation functionality in a mobility test facility/proving ground.

OCTANE was developed at University of Michigan's Mcity Test Facility to enhance the user experience while testing connected and automated vehicles.

# About Mcity
Mcity funds research and provides testing at our one-of-a-kind proving ground simulating the complexities of an urban environment, and through on-road vehicle deployments to a variety of settings in Ann Arbor and Southeast Michigan.

Mcity brings together partners from industry, government, and academia to develop the foundation for an ecosystem of connected and automated vehicles for moving people and goods. Such a system has the potential to dramatically improve safety, sustainability, and accessibility.

# Why OCTANE?
The Mcity test facility is a highly automated and connected proving ground in Southeast Michigan. Mcity developed the OCTANE API giving facility users access to develop control, orchestration, and the ability to easily run repeatable tests at the facility. 

Our vision is that other facilities will implement the API standard on top of their hardware to provide a software abstraction layer of the facility. This allows mobility for tests and control scripts between multiple facilities that may have dissimilar hardware, and devices. 

# Using the OCTANE
OCTANE is a specification for an API written using Swagger. The easiest way to edit and visualize the API is by loading the api.yaml file into the online editor at https://editor.swagger.io/

# Status of OCTANE
Currently OCTANE is a draft of a standard that Mcity is working to implement at their facility.

# Release schedule / numbering.
The latest version of the API lives in the master branch. 
Released are granted a Release Order Number (RON) and each RON will have it's own branch at time of release. 
The highest RON branch is the latest standard of the API.

As of 6/27/18 the API is currently under development and no official releases have been made.
